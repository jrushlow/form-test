# Demo Symfony forms with / without generated id's.

## Develop this app using the included docker environment
A Makefile has been included to provide a shortcut to many of the docker
and symfony commands commonly used. From the application dir, type ```make```
to see a list of whats included. This has been tested on Debian 9.x with docker 
and docker-compose installed

1. ```cp form_test/.docker/env.dist form_test/.docker/.env```

2. Modify form_test/.docker/.env to suite your needs.

3. ```cd form_test```

4. ~/form_test$ ```make build && make up``` to start the docker containers.

5. ~/form_test$ ```make setup``` Run's composer install.

6. ~/form_test$ ```make create``` to create the database inside the mariadb container.

7. ~/form_test$ ```make persist``` persist migrations to the database.

8. ~/form_test$ ```make fixtures``` add dummy objects to the database for development.

9. Goto http://localhost to view the app

## Problem

The Foo & Bar entities are identical with the exception that Bar's id property is
not auto generated by the database. 

As is, you can create and update Foo objects. But you can only update Bar objects.
When attempting to create a new Bar object, ```This value should not be null.``` is
given as the reason for failure. Referring to the hidden id field in the form.
